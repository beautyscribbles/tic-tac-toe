	<p>  The overall flow of the game works as such -

	The game begins by initializing an empty 3x3 board, represented as a list of lists.

	The main function is called, which enters a loop that continues until the game is won or the board is full.

	Within the loop, the draw_board function is called to print the current state of the board to the console.

	The get_human_move function is called to allow the human player to enter their move. This function prompts the user to enter a column and row, and then places an "X" at that position on the board if it is a valid move.

	The has_winner function is called to check if the game has been won by the human player. If the function returns True, the loop is broken and the game ends.

	If the game is not yet won, the draw_board function is called again to update the board with the human player's move.

	<p>The get_computer_move function is called to allow the computer player to make a move. This function generates a random column and row, and then places an "O" at that position on the board if it is a valid move.</p>

	<p>The has_winner function is called again to check if the game has been won by the computer player. If the function returns True, the loop is broken and the game ends.</p>

	<p>If the game is not yet won, the loop continues and the players take turn making moves until the game is won or the board is fun </p>l
